function[repData] = makeWeightedReplicates(data, weight, dataRoundingDP, weightingInflationMultiplier)
%%% This function takes some data and some weighting and creates
%%% the variable repData, which is a single variable that approximates the
%%% weighting of the data by replicating each x by approximately it's
%%% weighting. For example, if x=3 has a weighting y=4, then the value 3
%%% will be repeated 4 times in repData.
